import React from 'react'

// 4. Alerts are boring. Let's use a modal instead. Requirements:
// 4.1 The modal should be hidden by default
// 4.2 The modal should be able to be opened by clicking a user in the list from before.
// 4.3 The modal should contain the user's fullName and email
// 4.4 The modal should be able to be closed by clicking a close button
// 4.5 Render the modal.

// Consider:
// - Don't worry about styling too much. a white square in the center of the page is enough.
// - Where do you put the component?
// - What props/state/lifecycle methods/logic are needed?
